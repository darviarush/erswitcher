Urgent:

  - Fix a bug when there is more than one button in a key
    combinaison.
    ref: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/xbindkeys-devel/2009-05/msg00001.html
    Update: Only one button is bound at a time (the last defined in
    the rc configuration file). And only one button is grabbed even
    when there is more than one button in the configuration file.
    => need more info.

Maybe:

  - Replace the XNextEvent with a XPeekEvent/XNextEvent in the main
    loop to let the event pass to the underlying X application on some
    criteria.

make a documentation more easy to understand :)

convert NEWS file to the standard NEWS file format
convert ChangeLog file to the standard ChangeLog file format
convert AUTHORS file to the standard AUTHORS file format
create a nice printable readme for printing (LaTeX or DocBook?)
